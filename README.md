# Good README Generator

![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-Green)

  ## Description
The goal of this project is to create a command-line application that allows the user to generate a README.md file quickly and easily. The project achieves this goal by asking the user to imput the key points they require for their README file into the command-line, which then slots in this information into a pre-written README template ready to use.

## Usage
This application is easily run by opening the file index.js, entering the command ```node index.js``` into the command-line and proceeding to answer the questions that follow. This is an example of how it looks at this stage ![image](assets/ques-screenshot.jpg) When all the questions have been answered, a README.md file will be generated with all of the answers to these questions.
